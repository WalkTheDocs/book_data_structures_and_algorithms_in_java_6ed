What are some potential efficiency disadvantages of having very deep inheritance trees, that is, a large set of classes, A, B, C, and so on, such that B extends A, C extends B, D extends C, etc.?

Deep inheritance trees could make debugging a problem. With deep trees it will become more difficult to find the source code that is causing the issues, particularity if the method has been overridden at some point. When refactoring, you also risk breaking the functionality of child classes
