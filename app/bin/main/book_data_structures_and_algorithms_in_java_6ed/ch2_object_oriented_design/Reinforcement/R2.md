Any application that exists in a competative market. With the ease of modern software developement
and the availability offered by the modern cloud virtually anyone could set up a site/service to compete:
if the currently available services aren't meeting demand, eventually someone else will move in to fill the gaps.

Often times being the first to act is more important than being the best. It's often better to release a simple feature
that can be expanded upon throughout time than to release code in large chunks. Iterating in smaller increments also
allows you to change direction more easily if needed.
