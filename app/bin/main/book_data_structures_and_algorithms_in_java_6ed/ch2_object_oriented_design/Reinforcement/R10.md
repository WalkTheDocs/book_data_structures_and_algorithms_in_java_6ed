What are some potential efficiency disadvantages of having very shallow inheritance trees, that is, a large set of classes, A, B, C, and so on, such that all of these classes extend a single class, Z?

You would be unable to share code between a portion of the tree. It would become difficult to tell which children are using a given method in the parent. In the extreme case that there is only one parent this is especially problematic. You would be forced to group all of your functionality into one common class: a monolith.
