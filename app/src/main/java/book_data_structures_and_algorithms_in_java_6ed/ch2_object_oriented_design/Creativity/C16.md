# C16

Suppose you are on the design team for a new e-book reader. What are the
primary classes and methods that the Java software for your reader will need?
You should include an inheritance diagram for this code, but you donâ€™t need to
write any actual code. Your software architecture should at least include ways for
customers to buy new books, view their list of purchased books, and read their
purchased books.

## Classes

* [x] buy new books.
* [x] view list of purchased books.
* [x] read purchased books. 

### User

```java
interface User {
    String uuid;
    Library library;
}
```

### Library

```java
interface Library {
    String uuid;
    String userId;
    String[] bookIds;

    /**
     * Get book using bookIds
     **/
    Book[] getBooks();

    Book readBook(String bookId);
}
```

### Store

```java
interface Store {
    String uuid;
    Book[] showing;

    getBooksByAuthor(String authorId)

    getBooksByGenre(String GenreId)

    buyBook(String bookId, String userId)
}
```

### Book

```java
interface Book {
    String uuid;
    String title;
    String description;
    String imagePath;
    float price;
    BookText[] texts;

    // Book meta data
    Author author;
    Genre genre;
    // ...etc
}
```

```java
interface BookText {
    String bookId;
    int order; // Long books might have more than one BookText;
    String text;
}
```
