# R12

Draw a class inheritance diagram for the following set of classes:

* Class Goat extends Object and adds an instance variable tail and methods milk( ) and jump( ).
* Class Pig extends Object and adds an instance variable nose and methods
eat(food) and wallow( ).
* Class Horse extends Object and adds instance variables height and color, 
and methods run( ) and jump( ).
* Class Racer extends Horse and adds a method race( ).
* Class Equestrian extends Horse and adds instance variable weight and is

```

                                            * isTrained()

# R13

Consider the inheritance of classes from Exercise R-2.12, and let d be an object
variable of type Horse. If d refers to an actual object of type Equestrian, can it
be cast to the class Racer? Why or why not?

No, in Java we can only cast classes up or down the inheritance tree, not across.
